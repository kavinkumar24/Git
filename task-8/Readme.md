## Location of Git Hooks
The Git hooks folder is located at `./git/hooks`. In this folder, Git provides some sample files that can be customized to create your own hooks.

## Types of Hooks

### Client-side Hooks
1. `pre-commit`
2. `prepare-commit-msg`
3. `commit-msg`
4. `post-commit`
5. `pre-rebase`
6. `post-checkout`
7. `post-merge`

### Server-side Hooks
1. `pre-receive`
2. `update`
3. `post-receive`

In this guide, we will focus on using two commit hooks:
- `pre-commit`
- `commit-msg`

## Pre-commit Hook

- The `pre-commit` hook is called before obtaining the proposed commit message and before the commit is made.
- It inspects the snapshot that is about to be committed to ensure it passes the pre-commit checks.
- If the pre-commit hook returns a non-zero status (1), the commit is aborted.
- This hook can be used to check for specific conditions (e.g., empty files, secrets) before committing the code.
- In this example, we used this hook to:
  - Check if the API key is empty in the file. If it is, the commit is blocked.
  - Check for empty files to avoid committing empty files.

## Commit-msg Hook

- The `commit-msg` hook is called after obtaining the proposed commit message.
- It checks if the commit message follows the required format before allowing the commit.
- If the commit message does not meet the criteria, the commit is blocked.
- In this example, we used this hook to:
  - Ensure the commit message has a minimum length of 4 characters.

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Feature File
- Create a file `initial_feature.txt` and add some text to it:
    ```bash
    echo "This is a feature file where it contains an Api key and it will captured by pre-commit hooks" > initial_feature.txt
    echo "Rapid_API_KEY = \"\"" >> initial_feature.txt
    ```
- This file contains an empty API key.

### Step 2: Implement Pre-commit and Commit-msg Hooks
1. **Navigate to the Git hooks folder**:
    ```bash
    cd ./.git/hooks
    ```

2. **Create the `pre-commit` hook**:
    - Create a `pre-commit` file using a shell script:
    ```bash
    #! C:/Program\ Files/Git/usr/bin/sh.exe
    echo "Running pre-commit hook..."

    # Create a temporary file to store names of empty files
    empty_files=$(mktemp)

    # Check for empty staged files
    git diff --cached --name-status | while read status file; do
    # If the file is not deleted and is empty, check it
    if [ "$status" != "D" ] && [ ! -s "$file" ]; then  # If file is empty and not deleted
        echo "$file" >> "$empty_files"  # Store file name in temporary file
    fi
    done

    # Check if any empty files were found
    if [ -s "$empty_files" ]; then  # If the temporary file is non-empty
        echo "Error: The following file(s) are empty and cannot be committed:"
        cat "$empty_files"  # Print the list of empty files
        rm "$empty_files"  # Clean up the temporary file
        exit 1  # Prevent the commit
    fi

    # Clean up the temporary file if no empty files are found
    rm "$empty_files"

    # Check for secrets in the code (generic API keys, AWS, GitHub, etc.)
    if git grep -E -i \
        '([A-Za-z0-9]+_API_KEY\s*=\s*"?[A-Za-z0-9]{32,40}"?)' \
        > /dev/null 2>&1; then  # /dev/null 2>&1 hides the output
        echo "Found a secret"
        exit 1  # Exit with non-zero status to prevent commit
    else
        echo "No secrets found"
    fi

    # Run ESLint on staged JavaScript files (example of running a linter)
    echo "Running ESLint on staged JavaScript files..."
    files=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E '\.js$')
    if [ -n "$files" ]; then
        eslint $files
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then  # If eslint fails (non-zero exit status)
            echo "Error: Linter failed. Fix the issues before committing."
            exit 1
        fi
    fi

        # eslint - it is a linter tool for javascript (testing syntax or any other bugs)
        # --cached: only staged changes
        # --name-only: only file names
        # -s - it is about some content present in the file (size)
        # -E - It is called extended regular expression, and it is used to match the pattern in the file in a custom way.
        # -i - case insensitive
        # > /dev/null - redirect output to null
        # 2>&1 - redirect stderr to stdout (2- stderr, 1- stdout)
    ```

3. **Create the `commit-msg` hook**:
    - Create a `commit-msg` file using a shell script:
    ```bash
    #! C:/Program\ Files/Git/usr/bin/sh.exe
    # Get the commit message file path
    COMMIT_MSG_FILE="$1"

    # Check if the commit message is at least 4 characters long (ignores newline)
    commit_message=$(<"$COMMIT_MSG_FILE")

    # Check if the message is at least 4 characters long
    if [ ${#commit_message} -lt 4 ]; then
        echo "Error: Commit message must be at least 4 characters long."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Allow commit if the message is valid
    exit 0
    ```

### Step 3: Commit Code
- Add the changes and attempt to commit:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial feature updated"
    ```

Output:
Running pre-commit hook... Error: The following file(s) are empty and cannot be committed: task-8/empty_file.txt


### Step 4: Commit Validation
- After deleting the empty file and staging the changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial feature updated"
    ```
- Output:
Running pre-commit hook... Found a secret


- If the commit message is too short (less than 4 characters):
    ```bash
    git commit -m "In"
    ```
- Output:


### Step 5: Install ESLint and Run Tests
1. **Install ESLint**:
    ```bash
    npm install eslint --save-dev
    ```

2. **Create a JavaScript file with some code** and attempt to commit:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Test JS code"
    ```

Output:
1:7 error 'firstname' is assigned a value but never used no-unused-vars 2:1 error 'lastname' is not defined no-undef

âœ– 2 problems (2 errors, 0 warnings)

Error: Linter failed. Fix the issues before committing



## How Git Hooks Improve Code Quality in Collaborative Projects

### 1. Automate Code Formatting and Linting
- By using hooks, we can automate the process of code formatting and linting before committing the code.
- This ensures that the code adheres to coding standards and best practices.
- It helps in maintaining a consistent code style across the project.

### 2. Prevent Committing Sensitive Information
- Git hooks can be used to prevent committing sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and other secrets.
- By using pre-commit hooks, we can check for the presence of such information in the code and prevent the commit if any secrets are found.
- This helps in maintaining the security of the project and prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information.

### 3. Enforce Commit Message Guidelines
- Git hooks can enforce commit message guidelines by checking the format and content of the commit messages.
- By using commit-msg hooks, we can ensure that the commit messages are descriptive, meaningful, and follow a specific format.
- This helps in improving the readability of the commit history and makes it easier to track changes in the project.

### 4. Run Tests Before Committing
- Git hooks can be used to run automated tests before committing the code.
- By using pre-commit hooks, we can ensure that the code passes all the tests before it is committed.
- This helps in catching bugs and issues early in the development process and ensures the quality of the code.

### 5. Custom Validation and Checks
- Git hooks can be customized to perform specific validation and checks based on the project requirements.
- By writing custom hooks, we can enforce project-specific rules, checks, and validations before committing the code.
- This helps in maintaining the quality and consistency of the codebase and ensures that the project follows the defined guidelines.

### 6. Improve Collaboration and Code Review
- Git hooks help in improving collaboration and code review by automating repetitive tasks and checks.
- By using hooks, developers can focus on writing code while the hooks take care of formatting, linting, and other checks.
- This streamlines the development process, reduces manual effort, and improves the overall code quality in collaborative projects.
