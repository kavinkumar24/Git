location of Hooks folder -> ./git/hooks

in this by default we have some sample files, we can use those files to create our own hooks.
Types of Hooks
- Client-side Hooks
    1. pre-commit
    2. prepare-commit-msg
    3. commit-msg
    4. post-commit
    5. pre-rebase
    6. post-checkout
    7. post-merge

- Server-side Hooks
    1. pre-receive
    2. update
    3. post-receive

- In this I used 2 commit hooks
    1. pre-commit
    2. commit-msg

- pre-commit 
    - This hook is called before obtaining the proposed commit message and before the commit is made.
    - It is used to inspect the snapshot that is about to be committed, to see if it passes the pre-commit hook.
    - If the pre-commit hook returns a non-zero status(1), the commit is aborted.
    - This hook is used to check the code before committing the code.
    - In this I used this hook to check the Api key in the file, if it is empty then it will not allow to commit the code, and also checked to avoid the empty files being committed.

- commit-msg
    - This hook is called after obtaining the proposed commit message.
    - It is used to check the commit message before committing the code.
    - If the commit message is not in the proper format then it will not allow to commit the code.
    - In this I used this hook to check the commit message, if it is not in the length of 4 then it will not allow to commit the code.


Steps:

- Step 1: 
    - created a initial_feature txt file  and added some text to it.
    - echo "This is a feature file where it contains an Api key and it will captured by pre-commit hooks" > initial_feature.txt
    - echo "Rapid_API_KEY = \"\"" >> initial_feature.txt
    - file created with empty Rapid_API_KEY

- Step 2:
    - go to git hooks folder
    - cd ./.git/hooks
    - created a pre-commit file
    - by using a bash script
    - shell script
        #! C:/Program\ Files/Git/usr/bin/sh.exe
        echo "Running pre-commit hook..."

        # Create a temporary file to store names of empty files
        empty_files=$(mktemp)

        # Check for empty staged files
        git diff --cached --name-only | while read file; do
            if [ ! -s "$file" ]; then  # If file is empty
                echo "$file" >> "$empty_files"  # Store file name in temporary file
            fi
        done

        # Check if any empty files were found
        if [ -s "$empty_files" ]; then  # If the temporary file is non-empty
            echo "Error: The following file(s) are empty and cannot be committed:"
            cat "$empty_files"  # Print the list of empty files
            rm "$empty_files"  # Clean up the temporary file
            exit 1  # Prevent the commit
        fi

        # Clean up the temporary file if no empty files are found
        rm "$empty_files"

        # Check for secrets in the code (generic API keys, AWS, GitHub, etc.)
        if git grep -E -i \
            '([A-Za-z0-9]+_API_KEY\s*=\s*"?[A-Za-z0-9]{32,40}"?)' \
            > /dev/null 2>&1; then  # /dev/null 2>&1 hides the output
            echo "Found a secret"
            exit 1  # Exit with non-zero status to prevent commit
        else
            echo "No secrets found"
        fi

        # Run ESLint on staged JavaScript files (example of running a linter)
        echo "Running ESLint on staged JavaScript files..."
        files=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E '\.js$')
        if [ -n "$files" ]; then
            eslint $files
            if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then  # If eslint fails (non-zero exit status)
                echo "Error: Linter failed. Fix the issues before committing."
                exit 1
            fi
        fi
        # eslint - it is a linter tool for javascript (testing syntax or any other bugs)
        # --cached: only staged changes
        # --name-only: only file names
        # -s - it is about some content present in the file (size)
        # -E - It is called extended regular expression, and it is used to match the pattern in the file in a custom way.
        # -i - case insensitive
        # > /dev/null - redirect output to null
        # 2>&1 - redirect stderr to stdout (2- stderr, 1- stdout)

    
    - created a commit-msg file
    - by using a bash script

    #! C:/Program\ Files/Git/usr/bin/sh.exe
    # Get the commit message file path
    COMMIT_MSG_FILE="$1"

    # Check if the commit message is at least 4 characters long (ignores newline)
    commit_message=$(<"$COMMIT_MSG_FILE")

    # Check if the message is at least 4 characters long
    if [ ${#commit_message} -lt 4 ]; then
        echo "Error: Commit message must be at least 4 characters long."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Allow commit if the message is valid
    exit 0

    # lt -less than


- Step 3:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "Initial feature updated"

Output:
    - Running pre-commit hook...
    - 
    git commit -m "Initial feature updated"
    Running pre-commit hook...
    Error: The following file(s) are empty and cannot be committed:
    task-8/empty_file.txt

------------------------ After deleted the empty file and staged the changes ------------------------

    git commit -m "Initial feature updated"
    Running pre-commit hook...
    Found a secret

- Step 4:
   - deleted the empty file and removed the api key, it pass the pre-commit hook
   - git add .
   - git commit -m "In"
    - it will not allow to commit the code as the commit message is less than 4 characters

Output:

Running pre-commit hook...
No secrets found
Error: Commit message must be at least 4 characters long.

- Step 5
    - Installed eslint for testing js files
    - npm install eslint --save-dev
    - created a js file and added some code to it
    - git add, and commit the code

Output
    1:7  error  'firstname' is assigned a value but never used  no-unused-vars
    2:1  error  'lastname' is not defined                       no-undef

    âœ– 2 problems (2 errors, 0 warnings)

    Error: Linter failed. Fix the issues before committing.


How Git Hooks improve code quality in Collaborative Projects
1. Automate Code Formatting and Linting
    - By using hooks, we can automate the process of code formatting and linting before committing the code.
    - This ensures that the code adheres to the coding standards and best practices.
    - It helps in maintaining a consistent code style across the project.

2. Prevent Committing Sensitive Information
    - Git hooks can be used to prevent committing sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and other secrets.
    - By using pre-commit hooks, we can check for the presence of such information in the code and prevent the commit if any secrets are found.
    - This helps in maintaining the security of the project and prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information.

3. Enforce Commit Message Guidelines
    - Git hooks can enforce commit message guidelines by checking the format and content of the commit messages.
    - By using commit-msg hooks, we can ensure that the commit messages are descriptive, meaningful, and follow a specific format.
    - This helps in improving the readability of the commit history and makes it easier to track changes in the project.

4. Run Tests Before Committing
    - Git hooks can be used to run automated tests before committing the code.
    - By using pre-commit hooks, we can ensure that the code passes all the tests before it is committed.
    - This helps in catching bugs and issues early in the development process and ensures the quality of the code.

5. Custom Validation and Checks
    - Git hooks can be customized to perform specific validation and checks based on the project requirements.
    - By writing custom hooks, we can enforce project-specific rules, checks, and validations before committing the code.
    - This helps in maintaining the quality and consistency of the codebase and ensures that the project follows the defined guidelines.

6. Improve Collaboration and Code Review
    - Git hooks help in improving collaboration and code review by automating repetitive tasks and checks.
    - By using hooks, developers can focus on writing code while the hooks take care of formatting, linting, and other checks.
    - This streamlines the development process, reduces manual effort, and improves the overall code quality in collaborative projects.
